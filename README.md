## What is the Aviator Game? üõ´

The Aviator game is a unique online betting game that is quite different
from traditional casino games. Instead of spinning reels or betting on
cards, Aviator involves a plane that takes off, and the goal is to cash
out before the plane flies away. The longer you wait, the higher your
potential winnings, but if you wait too long and the plane disappears,
you lose your bet. It's a game of strategy, risk, and timing.
